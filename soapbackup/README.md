The SoapAPI structs were generated using gowsdl.
There are some shell scripts in this DIR containing info on how to regenerate an unmodified netsuite.go soap connector using gowsdl.
This included unmodified netsuite.go file is used for reference and cannot be used as is to directly create a soap client, without further modification.
